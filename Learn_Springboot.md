Since you're a JavaScript developer transitioning to Spring Boot, you can integrate learning Java with Spring Boot in a structured plan. Based on the Udemy course outline and your goal, here’s a 4-week plan (adjustable based on your pace). Each week includes Java fundamentals tied to Spring Boot concepts, with hands-on practice. Assume 1-2 hours daily.

### Week 1: Java Basics for Spring Boot Foundation
- **Focus**: OOP and Core Java Concepts
- **Udemy Sections**: 
  - Section 8: Advanced OOP Techniques (2hr 36min) - Composition, Encapsulation
  - Section 11: Mastering Abstraction & Interfaces (1hr 17min) - Key for Spring’s design
- **Activities**:
  - Day 1-2: Watch Section 8, code simple classes with composition and encapsulation.
  - Day 3-4: Watch Section 11, create interfaces and implement them in a small project.
  - Day 5: Build a basic Java app (e.g., a library system with books and users using OOP).
- **Spring Boot Intro**: Day 6-7: Install JDK and Spring Boot (use Spring Initializr), create a simple "Hello World" REST API.

### Week 2: Data Structures and Lambdas
- **Focus**: Collections and Modern Java
- **Udemy Sections**: 
  - Section 10: Mastering Lists, Iterators, and Autoboxing (2hr 37min) - ArrayList, LinkedList
  - Section 14: Mastering Java Lambdas (2hr 16min) - Expressions, interfaces
- **Activities**:
  - Day 1-2: Watch Section 10, practice using ArrayList and LinkedList.
  - Day 3-4: Watch Section 14, experiment with lambda expressions.
  - Day 5: Combine collections and lambdas in a Java app (e.g., filter a list of objects).
- **Spring Boot**: Day 6-7: Extend the REST API to handle a list of objects (e.g., books), use a basic repository.

### Week 3: Generics and Spring Boot Core
- **Focus**: Advanced Java and Spring Basics
- **Udemy Sections**: 
  - Section 12: Deep Dive into Java Generics (1hr 57min) - Bounds, Comparators
  - Section 15: Mastering Java Collections (36min) - Frameworks, Lists, Sets, Maps
- **Activities**:
  - Day 1-2: Watch Section 12, create generic classes or methods.
  - Day 3-4: Watch Section 15, practice using Maps and Sets.
  - Day 5: Build a Java app using generics and collections (e.g., a student grade tracker).
- **Spring Boot**: Day 6-7: Learn Spring Data JPA, create a simple entity (e.g., Book) and basic CRUD operations.

### Week 4: Integration and Practice
- **Focus**: Tying It All Together
- **Udemy Sections**: 
  - Section 16: Mastering Mutability, Immutability (33min) - Final keyword
  - Review Sections 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 as needed
- **Activities**:
  - Day 1-2: Watch Section 16, practice immutable objects.
  - Day 3-4: Review weak areas from prior weeks, refactor code.
  - Day 5: Build a small Java project combining all concepts (e.g., a task manager).
- **Spring Boot**: Day 6-7: Enhance the CRUD app, add a REST controller, and deploy it locally (e.g., using embedded Tomcat).

### Tips:
- **Tools**: Use IntelliJ IDEA (community edition) for Java/Spring Boot development.
- **Resources**: Follow Spring Boot official docs (spring.io) alongside Udemy.
- **Practice**: Code daily, even small exercises, to reinforce Java and Spring concepts.
- **Pace**: If 1-2 hours daily is too much, stretch to 6-8 weeks, ensuring consistency.

By the end, you’ll have a working Spring Boot app and a solid Java base to grow from. Adjust based on your progress!
