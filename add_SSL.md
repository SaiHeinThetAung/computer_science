Ah, perfect â€” your **DevOps team gave you a `.jks` certificate**! ðŸ”¥  
That makes it **even easier** to set up HTTPS for your Spring Boot + WebSocket (`wss://`) server.

Iâ€™ll guide you step-by-step ðŸ‘‡

---

## âœ¨ How to use the `.jks` file in Spring Boot

1. **Put the `.jks` file inside your project** (usually inside `src/main/resources/` folder).

   Example:  
   You save it as:

   ```
   src/main/resources/your-keystore.jks
   ```

2. **Configure your `application.properties`**

   Add these lines:

   ```properties
   server.port=443

   server.ssl.key-store=classpath:your-keystore.jks
   server.ssl.key-store-password=your-password
   server.ssl.key-store-type=JKS
   server.ssl.key-alias=your-alias
   ```

   | Property | Meaning |
   |:---|:---|
   | `key-store` | Path to your `.jks` file (from classpath) |
   | `key-store-password` | Password DevOps gave you |
   | `key-store-type` | It's `JKS` (Java Key Store) |
   | `key-alias` | Alias inside the `.jks` (DevOps should tell you this) |

---

## âœ¨ Example

Suppose your DevOps sent you:

| Item | Value |
|:---|:---|
| File | `drone-server.jks` |
| Password | `dronepass123` |
| Alias | `dronessl` |

Then in your `application.properties`, you will write:

```properties
server.port=443

server.ssl.key-store=classpath:drone-server.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password=dronepass123
server.ssl.key-store-type=JKS
server.ssl.key-alias=dronessl
```

âœ… Done.

When you start your Spring Boot app, it will serve HTTPS, and your WebSocket will be **wss://yourdomain/telemetry**.

## âš¡ Important Tips

- Make sure `server.port=443` or **use a different port if 443 is already occupied**.
- Make sure the `.jks` file is inside `src/main/resources/` so Spring Boot can find it.
- If DevOps also set hostname verification, you might need to configure that too (rare case).
- If you test **locally**, you might get a **browser security warning** because it's a **self-signed cert**. In production, it will be fine.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ After HTTPS is ready

- On **frontend or drone clients**:
  
  Change:
  
  ```javascript
  new WebSocket('ws://your-server-ip/telemetry');
  ```
  
  to:
  
  ```javascript
  new WebSocket('wss://your-server-ip/telemetry');
  ```

---

## ðŸ›¡ What if DevOps gave only `.crt` and `.key` files instead of `.jks`?

Sometimes DevOps might give:
- `certificate.crt`
- `privatekey.key`

If so, you have to **convert them to `.jks`** using Java `keytool` command.

But in your case, **you already have `.jks`**, so **no need to convert**. ðŸ”¥

---

## âœ‹ Final checklist for you:
| Task | Done? |
|:---|:---|
| Place `.jks` file into `resources/` | âœ… |
| Configure `application.properties` for SSL | âœ… |
| Change WebSocket URL to `wss://` | âœ… |
| Open 443 port on server | âœ… |
| Test from browser or drone client | âœ… |
