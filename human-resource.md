✅ **Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment (Timescale Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes)** → **DevOps Engineer**  

---

### **📌 Hiring Plan Based on Development Phases**
| **Phase** | **Team Members Needed** |
|----------|------------------|
| **MVP (3-6 months)** | 1 Tech Lead, 2 Senior Devs, 2 Mid-Level Devs, 1 DevOps |
| **Scaling (6-12 months)** | Add 2-3 Mid-Level, 1-2 Junior, 1 Database Engineer |
| **Production (12+ months)** | Expand based on performance needs |

---

### **💡 Alternative Lean Team Approach (6-8 Developers)**
If you want to **start with a smaller team**, you can begin with:  
- **1 Tech Lead**  
- **2 Senior Backend Developers**  
- **2 Mid-Level Backend Developers**  
- **1 Database Engineer**  
- **1 DevOps Engineer**  

Then, **scale up as the project grows**. 🚀

### **📌 Next Steps**
Would you like:  
1️⃣ **A detailed roadmap** for hiring & structuring the team?  
2️⃣ **Sprint-based task breakdown** for each backend role?  
3️⃣ **Interview question suggestions** for backend candidates?

With **5 junior developers** and no senior or lead developers, the probability of **successful and timely project completion** depends on several factors:  

---

### **🔍 Challenges & Risks**  
1️⃣ **Lack of Senior Guidance** → Junior devs may struggle with architecture, database optimization, and performance issues.  
2️⃣ **High Learning Curve** → Technologies like **Spring Boot, WebSockets, TimescaleDB, MAVLink, Kubernetes, and video streaming** require experience.  
3️⃣ **Risk of Delays & Rewrites** → Without experienced developers, the project may require multiple refactors, increasing development time.  
4️⃣ **Difficulties in Scaling & Security** → Complex tasks like **cloud database synchronization, CI/CD setup, and real-time telemetry handling** need expertise.  

---

### **🛠 How to Improve Success Probability?**  
✅ **Hire or Consult 1 Senior Developer or Tech Lead** → Even part-time, a **tech lead** can guide architectural decisions and code reviews.  
✅ **Follow a Lean MVP Approach** → Start with a **basic version** (telemetry storage + WebSockets) before adding complex features.  
✅ **Use Well-Documented Frameworks & Libraries** → Spring Boot **simplifies backend tasks**, but ensure your team follows best practices.  
✅ **Assign Clear Roles & Responsibilities** → Junior devs should focus on **specific tasks** (e.g., one handles telemetry, another handles video storage).  
✅ **Leverage Cloud Services & Open-Source Solutions** → Instead of custom implementations, use **managed services** like AWS S3, Timescale Cloud, and WebRTC.  

---

### **📊 Success Probability Based on Your Current Team**
| **Scenario** | **Estimated Success Rate** | **Expected Development Time** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **No Senior Devs, Only Juniors** | **30-40%** | **12-18 months (high risk of delays & rewrites)** |
| **Hire 1 Tech Lead (Even Part-Time)** | **60-70%** | **8-12 months (better direction, fewer rewrites)** |
| **Hire 1 Tech Lead + 1 Senior Backend Developer** | **80-90%** | **6-9 months (best balance of guidance & execution)** |

**⚠️ Without senior oversight, there's a high risk of missing deadlines or reworking large parts of the project.**

### **🚀 Recommended Next Steps**
Would you like:  
1️⃣ **A phased development roadmap for junior developers**?  
2️⃣ **Hiring suggestions for a tech lead or mentor**?  
3️⃣ **A simplified version of the project to reduce complexity**?
