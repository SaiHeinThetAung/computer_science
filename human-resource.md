### **📊 Backend Development Tasks Breakdown**
✅ **API & WebSocket Development** → **Senior + Mid-Level Devs**  
✅ **Database Design & Optimization** → **Database Engineer + Mid-Level Devs**  
✅ **Real-Time Telemetry Handling (MAVLink, MQTT, WebSocket)** → **Senior Devs**  
✅ **Mission Planner & Waypoints System** → **Mid-Level + Junior Devs**  
✅ **Video Storage & Processing (FFmpeg, S3, WebRTC)** → **Senior + Mid-Level Devs**  
✅ **Security & Authentication (OAuth2, JWT, Role-based access)** → **Tech Lead + DevOps Engineer**  
✅ **Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment (Timescale Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes)** → **DevOps Engineer**  

---

### **📌 Hiring Plan Based on Development Phases**
| **Phase** | **Team Members Needed** |
|----------|------------------|
| **MVP (3-6 months)** | 1 Tech Lead, 2 Senior Devs, 2 Mid-Level Devs, 1 DevOps |
| **Scaling (6-12 months)** | Add 2-3 Mid-Level, 1-2 Junior, 1 Database Engineer |
| **Production (12+ months)** | Expand based on performance needs |

---

### **💡 Alternative Lean Team Approach (6-8 Developers)**
If you want to **start with a smaller team**, you can begin with:  
- **1 Tech Lead**  
- **2 Senior Backend Developers**  
- **2 Mid-Level Backend Developers**  
- **1 Database Engineer**  
- **1 DevOps Engineer**  

Then, **scale up as the project grows**. 🚀  

---

### **📌 Next Steps**
Would you like:  
1️⃣ **A detailed roadmap** for hiring & structuring the team?  
2️⃣ **Sprint-based task breakdown** for each backend role?  
3️⃣ **Interview question suggestions** for backend candidates?  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🎯
