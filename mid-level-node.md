Perfect! You’re already ahead of the curve — with Express, MongoDB, and JWT in your pocket **and** a junior backend job 👏 That means we can focus on helping you go from **junior → solid mid-level backend dev** and prep you to:
- **Build side projects confidently**
- **Handle more responsibilities at work**
- **Start understanding scalable, production-grade backend**

---

## ✅ Your Goal:
Become a strong **mid-level backend developer with Node.js**  
➡️ able to build and deploy complete, secure, and scalable backends

---

## ⏳ Assumption: You can spend ~8–10 hours/week  
(Adjustable — just let me know if that’s too much or too little)

---

## 🗓️ 6-Week Node.js Backend Deep-Dive Plan

### **🔹 Week 1: Clean Architecture & Project Structure**
- Learn layered architecture: `routes → controllers → services → models`
- Refactor a simple Express app using this structure
- Explore module aliasing with `module-alias` or path mapping

📚 Resources:
- Article: “Node.js Clean Architecture”
- Practice: Refactor your login/register system into this new structure

---

### **🔹 Week 2: Error Handling, Middlewares & Validations**
- Global error handler with `next(err)`
- Build custom error classes
- Learn `Joi` or `Zod` for validating request data
- Build custom middleware for logging, rate limiting, and authorization

🛠 Mini Project: Build an API with validation, error handling, and a custom middleware

---

### **🔹 Week 3: Caching, Redis & Performance**
- Learn Redis basics and connect it with Node
- Cache GET requests using Redis
- Intro to performance optimization (avoid redundant DB calls)

📚 Resources:
- “Redis with Node.js” guide
- Article: “Node.js Performance Tips”

---

### **🔹 Week 4: Async Patterns, Background Jobs, and Real-time**
- Understand `async/await` deeply
- Explore queues with `Bull` or `Agenda`
- Try WebSockets with `Socket.io` for chat/notification system

🛠 Mini Project: Notification or live chat feature using sockets

---

### **🔹 Week 5: Docker, Deployment & Environment Config**
- Dockerize your Node.js app
- Use `.env` files for config
- Learn how to deploy to Vercel, Render, or DigitalOcean (bonus: setup NGINX + PM2)

📚 Resources:
- “Docker Node.js Tutorial”
- Bonus: CI/CD intro with GitHub Actions

---

### **🔹 Week 6: Testing, Security & Final Polishing**
- Learn unit testing with `Jest` and API testing with `Supertest`
- Protect against NoSQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Use `helmet`, sanitize input, and secure cookies

🛠 Final Task: Build a small blog API or todo list API with:
- JWT Auth
- Validations
- Redis Caching
- Dockerized
- Fully tested

---

## 📦 Tools You'll Use:
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB, Redis
- JWT, Helmet
- Bull (jobs), Socket.io (realtime)
- Docker, PM2
- Jest, Supertest

---

### 🚀 After This Plan:
- You'll be job-ready for **mid-level Node.js roles**
- You’ll be able to build **your own backend for fullstack or SaaS projects**
- You’ll understand how to scale and secure your apps better
