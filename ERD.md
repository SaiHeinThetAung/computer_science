Your ERD includes multiple tables related to flights, drones, pilots, and maintenance. To improve the database design, we should add appropriate relationships between tables. Below are some key relationships that should be explicitly defined:

### **Suggested Relationships**
1. **Users & Pilots**
   - **users_t (user_email) â†’ pilots_t (pilot_email)**
   - A user can be linked to a pilot, if applicable.

2. **Pilots & Flight Logs**
   - **pilots_t (pilot_id) â†’ flightlogs_t (pilot_inid, pilot_outid)**
   - A flight log should reference the pilot who flew the drone.

3. **Pilots & Pilot Logs**
   - **pilots_t (pilot_id) â†’ pilotlogs_t (pilot_id)**
   - A pilot log should be linked to a specific pilot.

4. **Pilots & Work Schedules**
   - **pilots_t (pilot_id) â†’ workschedules_t (pilot_no1, pilot_no2)**
   - Assigning pilots to work schedules.

5. **Ships & Drones**
   - **ships_t (ship_id) â†’ drones_t (ship_id)**
   - A drone should belong to a specific ship.

6. **Ships & Flights**
   - **ships_t (ship_id) â†’ flightlogs_t (ship_id)**
   - **ships_t (ship_id) â†’ preflightlog_t (ship_id)**
   - **ships_t (ship_id) â†’ postflightlog_t (ship_id)**
   - Every flight log should reference the ship involved.

7. **Drones & Flight Logs**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ flightlogs_t (drone_id)**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ preflightlog_t (drone_id)**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ inflightlog_t (drone_id)**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ postflightlog_t (drone_id)**
   - Every flight log should be linked to a specific drone.

8. **Drones & Maintenance**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ reportrrepars_t (drone_id1, drone_id2)**
   - **drones_t (drone_id) â†’ worktransfer_t (drone_id1, drone_id2)**
   - Maintenance logs should track which drone was repaired.

9. **Mechanics & Repairs**
   - **mechanics_t (mechanic_no) â†’ reportrrepars_t (mechanic_no)**
   - **mechanics_t (mechanic_no) â†’ worktransfer_t (mechanic_no)**
   - Each repair log should be linked to the mechanic who performed the repair.

10. **Material Tracking**
    - **materials_t (material_serialno) â†’ materiallog_t (material_serialno)**
    - **materialitems_t (material_id) â†’ materials_t (material_serialno)**
    - Ensuring material tracking is linked to specific repair logs.

11. **Reports & Ships**
    - **ships_t (ship_id) â†’ reports_t (doc_user)**
    - Reports should be tied to the ship where an incident or report was filed.

12. **Reports & Pilots**
    - **pilots_t (pilot_id) â†’ reports_t (doc_user)**
    - If reports are tied to a specific pilot.

13. **Fish Detection Logs**
    - **fishinfo_t (fish_id) â†’ inflightlog_t (fish_id)**
    - To track detected fish per flight.

### **Next Steps**
- Ensure **foreign key constraints** are applied in your database schema.
- Update the ERD to reflect these relationships.
- Define **cascading rules** for deletions (e.g., if a pilot is deleted, should their flight logs remain?).

Would you like me to generate an updated ERD diagram based on these relationships? ðŸš€
